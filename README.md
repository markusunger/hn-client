# Hacker News client in React
This is a very simple experiment with the Hacker News API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API). The API itself is basically unusable without any kind of caching in between as every single comment and story need to be requested individually.

Nevertheless, this is a small React app with my preferred way of displaying HN: two panes, all stories on the left, comments on the right.
